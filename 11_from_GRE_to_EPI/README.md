# Pulseq tutorial "From GRE to EPI"

Welcome to the "From GRE to EPI" tutorial repository! This was initially developed for the live Pulseq software demonstration and hands-on session at **MRI Together 2021** on-line conference. 

## Quick links

Pulseq Matlab repository: 
https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq

Dropbox link to the measured data and sequences (viewing only): 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i7f1gpwyigdugps/AACd2jQJg_WjoTY2nqh7O8IHa?dl=0

## Quick instructions

Check out the main *Pulseq* repository at https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq and familarizing yourself with the code, example sequences and reconstructon scripts (see 
[pulseq/matlab/demoSeq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoSeq) and [pulseq/matlab/demoRecon](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoRecon)). If you already use Pulseq, consider updating to the current version.

[Handout materials](Handout.pdf) that accompanied the original session are available in the PDF format containing the slides from the presentation with some additional material and explanations. In particular, the second part of the document (page 18 and on) describe the code examples. Please keep in mind that these examples were specifically developed for the demo, so you might find some useful information there even if you are familiar with the previous versions of Pulseq. 

Source code of the demo sequences and reconstruction scripts is the core of this repository. Please download the files to your computer and make them available to Matlab (e.g. by saving them in a subdirectory inside your Pulseq-Matlab installation and adding them to the Matlab's path). Yhere are two sub-directories:

* seq : contains example pulse sequences specifically prepared for this demo
* recon : contains the reconstruction scripts tested with the above sequences

The raw MR data, sequences in Pulseq format and examples of the reconstructed images can be accessed via the anonymous Dropbox link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i7f1gpwyigdugps/AACd2jQJg_WjoTY2nqh7O8IHa?dl=0 

The Dropbox repository entails the subdirectory "dataPrerecorded", which contains data and sequence examples generated prior to the session.
