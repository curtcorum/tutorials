# tutorials
This is a collection of various Pulseq tutorials, which is supposed to grow in future. 

The tutorials are ordered by increasing complexity, so if unsure where to start, 01_... is a good option. 

In more detail, the naming convention is 

`LN_Topic`

where 

* **L** is a one-digit level going from 0 for *beginner* to 1 for *intermediate* to 2 *advanced*;
* **N** is a sequential single-digit number (this assumes we can only have up to 9 tutorials per complexity level);
* **Topic** is a free text briefly describing the scope of the tutorial.
