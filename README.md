**Welcome to the Pulse tutorials repository!**

This is a collection of various Pulseq tutorials, which is supposed to grow in future. If you don't know where to start study the [Pulseq Concepts](./pulseq_Concepts_Nov2022.pdf) presentation and then work through the tutorials one-by-one. Please let us know if your favorite topic is missing or needs more attention, we will do our best to cover it in future.

# Tutorials
The tutorials are ordered by increasing complexity, so if unsure where to start, 01_... is a good option. 

In more detail, the naming convention is 

`LN_Topic`

where 

* **L** is a one-digit level going from 0 for *beginner* to 1 for *intermediate* to 2 *advanced*;
* **N** is a sequential single-digit number (this assumes we can only have up to 9 tutorials per complexity level);
* **Topic** is a free text briefly describing the scope of the tutorial.
